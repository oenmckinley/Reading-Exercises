Line A:

     Yes, the code does check the type, and the printed output is "C.foo".

Line B:

     No, it simply fails to compile because the interface I has no method
     called "bar".

Subtyping seems as though it is more precise than simply using a single
type, in that if you were to just use type C for all variables, but some
never need the bar procedure, it would be superfluous to keep this code
around despite it being unnecessary. For example, the "List" interface is more
specific to a certain set of needs than simply using Array Lists or Linked
Lists would be. However, that being said, it also means that, although the
interface and class may be extremely similar, you are more limited in how
you can utilize them; the increased precision comes at the cost of limiting
use. For instance, in Lists, you cannot use all of the methods from an
Array List, even if the imlementation is similar.
