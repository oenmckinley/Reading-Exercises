Exercise for February 10

For the recurrance given:

    T'(0) = 0
    T'(n) = 1 + T'(n - 2)

when the given n is even (that is, divisible by 2), then the recurrance
will give "T'(n) = n/2". However, if the given n is odd, then the base case
of T'(0) = 0 is never reached, and therefore the cycle will keep going and
tend towards infinity. Generalizing to any formula of the form:

     T'(0) = 0
     T'(n) = x + T'(n - k)

where n, x, and k are numbers such that k divides n evenly (for the reasons
stated above), then we know that "T'(n) = x * n/k". This is because the
recursion will happen n/k times before the base case is reached, and each
time recursion occurs, another x is added. However, in all of these cases,
the Big-O will always be "O(n)", because the resulting formula will always
be of that family of functions.
