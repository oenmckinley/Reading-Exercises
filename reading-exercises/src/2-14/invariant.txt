One possible loop invariant for this implementation of max in that ret must
be greater than or equal to all elements before arr[i] in the array
arr. For example, if i = 3, then ret >= arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]. The loop
does enforce this with a conditional "if (arr[i] < ret)" before the
assignment. To reitterate, an appropriate loop invariate is that ret >= all
arr[k], such that k < i, and the implementation does enforce this invariate
properly.
